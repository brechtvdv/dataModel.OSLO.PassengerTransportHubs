  These data models are mapped from version 2022-03-21 of the OSLO Passenger Transport Hubs (PTH) Application Profile (AP) standard. [Link](https://data.vlaanderen.be/doc/applicatieprofiel/Hoppinpunten)
Currently, this is still a Dutch-only AP called "OSLO Hoppinpunten", but an English extension will be made "OSLO Passenger Transport Hubs" during the Greenmov project.
